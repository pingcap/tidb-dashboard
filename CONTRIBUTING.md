# Contributing to TiDB Dashboard

Thanks for your interest in contributing to TiDB Dashboard! This document outlines some of the conventions on building, running, and testing TiDB Dashboard, the development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other resources.

If you need any help (for example, mentoring getting started or understanding the codebase), feel free to reach out on the [TiDB Internals forum](https://internals.tidb.io/).

## Setting up a development workspace

The following steps are describing how to develop TiDB Dashboard by running a self-built and standalone TiDB Dashboard server along with a separated TiDB cluster ([TiDB] + [TiKV] + [PD]). TiDB Dashboard cannot work without a TiDB cluster.

Although TiDB Dashboard can also be integrated into [PD], this form is not convenient for developing. Thus we will not cover it here.

### Step 1. Start a TiDB cluster

[TiUP](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/tiup-overview) is the official component manager for [TiDB]. It can help you set up a local TiDB cluster in a few minutes.

Download and install TiUP:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/install.sh | sh
```

Declare the global environment variable:

> [!Note]
>
> After the installation, TiUP displays the absolute path of the corresponding `profile` file. You need to modify the following `source` command according to the path.

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Start a local TiDB cluster:

```bash
tiup playground
```

You might notice that there is already a TiDB Dashboard integrated into the PD started by TiUP. For development purpose, it will not be used intentionally.

### Step 2. Prepare Dev Prerequisites

The followings are required for developing TiDB Dashboard:

- git - Version control
- make - Build tool (run common workflows)
- [Golang 1.21+](https://golang.org/) - To compile the server.
- [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/) - To compile the front-end.
- [PNPM 8](https://pnpm.io/) - To manage front-end dependencies.
- [Java 8+](https://www.java.com/ES/download/) - To generate JavaScript API client by OpenAPI specification.

### Step 3. Build and Run TiDB Dashboard

> Make sure that `tiup playground` is running on the background.

Package frontend and backend into a single binary:

   ```bash
   # Build a binary into `bin/tidb-dashboard`.
   make package
   
   # Run.
   make run
   ```

   You can access TiDB Dashboard now: [http://127.0.0.1:12333/dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:12333/dashboard)

#### Develop Frontend and Backend Separately

1. Build and run TiDB Dashboard back-end server:

   ```bash
   # In tidb-dashboard directory:
   make dev && make run
   ```

2. Build and run front-end server in a new terminal:

   ```bash
   # In tidb-dashboard directory:
   cd ui
   pnpm i # install all dependencies
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. That's it! You can access TiDB Dashboard now: [http://127.0.0.1:3001](http://127.0.0.1:3001)

### Step 4. Run E2E Tests (optional)

When back-end server and front-end server are both started, E2E tests can be run by:

```bash
cd ui/packages/tidb-dashboard-for-op
pnpm open:cypress
```

> Now we have only a few e2e tests. Contributions are welcome!

## Additional Guides

### Style Guidelines

This project follows the [Uber's Golang style guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md). Please refer to [its documentation](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md) for details.

### Swagger UI

We use [Swagger] to generate the API server and corresponding clients. Swagger provides a web UI in which you can
see all TiDB Dashboard API endpoints and specifications, or even send API requests.

Swagger UI is available at http://localhost:12333/dashboard/api/swagger after the above Step 3 is finished.

### Build and run docker image locally

If you want to develop docker image locally ðŸ¤”.

1. Ensure the Docker Buildx is installed on your local machine.
   
   > Docker Buildx is included in Docker Desktop for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
   > Docker Linux packages also include Docker Buildx when installed using the DEB or RPM packages.

2. Build the docker image.

   ```bash
   # On repository root directory (only build locally, no push remote), run:
   make docker-build-image-locally-amd64

   # Or, if you want to build the image for arm64 platform (only build locally, no push remote), run:
   make docker-build-image-locally-arm64

   # Or, if you want to build cross-platform image and push it to your dev docker registry, run:
   REPOSITORY=your-tidb-dashboard-repository make docker-build-and-push-image
   
    # Or, if you want to build centos7 based image, run:
   DOCKERFILE=./dockerfiles/centos7.Dockerfile make docker-build-image-locally-arm64

   # Finally, if you update npm modules or go modules, and want to disable docker layer cache to force rebuild, set NO_CACHE="--pull --no-cache" before make command. For example:
   NO_CACHE="--pull --no-cache" make docker-build-image-locally-amd64
   ```

3. Run newly build image with docker-compose.

   > Please make sure that `tiup playground` is not running on the background.
   
      ```bash
      # On repository root directory, run:
      docker-compose -f ./dockerfiles/docker-compose.yml up
      ```

4. Access TiDB Dashboard at [http://localhost:12333/dashboard](http://localhost:12333/dashboard).

> The old Dashboard **_in PD_** can be accessed at [http://localhost:2379/dashboard](http://localhost:2379/dashboard).

### How to update TiDB Dashboard in PD

To update the TiDB Dashboard in PD, we need to release a TiDB Dashboard version and submit a PR to PD.

1. In a release branch, likes `release-7.6`, run `make tag` to add a new tag for TiDB Dashboard. The new tag is like `v7.6.x-<sha>`.

1. Push the new tag to the remote repository, it will trigger the CI to release a new TiDB Dashboard version.

1. After the new version is created, go to https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-dashboard/actions/workflows/manual-create-pd-pr.yaml, click `Run workflow` button, fill the required parameters and submit the workflow, it will trigger the CI to create a PR to PD which will update the TiDB Dashboard version in PD.

## Contribution flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a Git branch from where you want to base your work. This is usually master.

- Write code, add test cases, and commit your work (see below for message format).

- Run lints and / or formatters.

  - Backend:

    ```bash
    # In tidb-dashboard directory:
    make dev
    ```

  - Frontend:

    ```bash
    # In ui directory:
    pnpm fmt-check
    ```

    > Recommended to install [Prettier plugin](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) for your editor so that there will be auto format on save.

- Run tests and make sure all tests pass.

- Push your changes to a branch in your fork of the repository and submit a pull request.

- Your PR will be reviewed by two maintainers, who may request some changes.

  - Once you've made changes, your PR must be re-reviewed and approved.

  - If the PR becomes out of date, you can use GitHub's 'update branch' button.

  - If there are conflicts, you can rebase (or merge) and resolve them locally. Then force push to your PR branch.
    You do not need to get re-review just for resolving conflicts, but you should request re-review if there are significant changes.

- Our CI system automatically tests all pull requests.

- If all tests passed and got an approval, reviewers will merge your PR.

Thanks for your contributions!

### Finding something to work on

For beginners, we have prepared many suitable tasks for you. Checkout our [help wanted issues](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-dashboard/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Astatus%2Fhelp-wanted+sort%3Aupdated-desc) for a list, in which we have also marked the difficulty level.

If you are planning something big, for example, relates to multiple components or changes current behaviors, make sure to open an issue to discuss with us before going on.

### Format of the commit message

We follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer two
questions: what changed and why. The subject line should feature the what and
the body of the commit should describe the why.

```plain
cluster: add comment for variable declaration.

Improve documentation.
```

The format can be described more formally as follows:

```plain
<subsystem>: <what changed>
<BLANK LINE>
<why this change was made>
<BLANK LINE>
```

If the change affects more than one subsystem, you can use comma to separate them like `keyviz, cluster: foo`.

If the change affects many subsystems, you can use `*` instead, like `*: foo`.

The body of the commit message should describe why the change was made and at a high level, how the code works.
