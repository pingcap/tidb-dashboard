# PD 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pingcap/pd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pingcap/pd)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/pingcap/pd)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/pingcap/pd)

PD is the abbreviation for Placement Driver. It is used to manage and schedule the [TiKV](https://github.com/pingcap/tikv) cluster. 

PD supports distribution and fault-tolerance by embedding [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd). 

## Build

1. Make sure [​*Go*​](https://golang.org/) (version 1.5+) is installed.
2. Use `make build` to install PD. PD is installed in the `bin` directory. 

## Usage

### PD ports

You can use the following default ports in PD:

+ **1234**: for client requests with customized protocol.
+ **9090**: for client requests with HTTP.
+ **2379**: for embedded etcd client requests 
+ **2380**: for embedded etcd peer communication.

You can change these ports when starting PD.

### Single Node with default ports

```bash
# Set correct HostIP here. 
export HostIP="192.168.199.105"

pd-server --cluster-id=1 \
          --host=${HostIP} \
          --name="pd" \
          --initial-cluster="pd=http://${HostIP}:2380" 
```

The command flag explanation:

+ `cluster-id`: The unique ID to distinguish different PD clusters. It can't be changed after bootstrapping.  
+ `host`: The host for outer traffic.
+ `name`: The human readable name for this node. 
+ `initial-cluster`: The initial cluster configuration for bootstrapping. 

Using `curl` to see PD member:

```bash
curl :2379/v2/members

{"members":[{"id":"f62e88a6e81c149","name":"default","peerURLs":["http://192.168.199.105:2380"],"clientURLs":["http://192.168.199.105:2379"]}]}
```

A better tool [httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) is recommended:

```bash
http :2379/v2/members
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Content-Type: application/json

{
    "members": [
        {
            "clientURLs": [
                "http://192.168.199.105:2379"
            ], 
            "id": "f62e88a6e81c149", 
            "name": "default", 
            "peerURLs": [
                "http://192.168.199.105:2380"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Docker

You can use the following command to build a PD image directly:

```
docker build -t pingcap/pd .
```

Or you can also use following command to get PD from Docker hub:

```
docker pull pingcap/pd
```

Run a single node with Docker: 

```bash
# Set correct HostIP here. 
export HostIP="192.168.199.105"

docker run -d -p 1234:1234 -p 9090:9090 -p 2379:2379 -p 2380:2380 --name pd pingcap/pd \
          --cluster-id=1 \
          --host=${HostIP} \
          --name="pd" \
          --initial-cluster="pd=http://${HostIP}:2380" 
```
